# stock-return-distribution
Explore the difference of the return distribution of two stocks when the given correlation coefficient is different

Assuming that the stock price follows the lognormal distribution, the yield of three stocks, the variance of yield fluctuation and the correlation coefficient of any two stocks' yield are given. Explore the difference of the yield distribution of two stocks when the given correlation coefficient is different, and show the results on the three-dimensional bar chart.
